# VS Code Configuration

This directory contains VS Code configuration files for the KitchenAI Assistant project.

## Files

- **tasks.json**: Task definitions for running individual services via VS Code
- **workspace.code-workspace**: Multi-root workspace configuration (reference copy)

## Important Note

The `workspace.code-workspace` file in this directory is a **reference copy** for documentation and version control purposes.

The **actual workspace file** used by VS Code is located at:
```
/home/mavioux/parakmh/cooking-assistant-application.code-workspace
```

If you make changes to the workspace configuration, remember to update both:
1. The actual workspace file (parent directory)
2. This reference copy (for git tracking)
